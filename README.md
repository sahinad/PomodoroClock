# PomodoroClock

Note: It was an intentional design choice that the user must press the "start" button to start every session--the clock won't move on to the next session automatically. When the work session finishes, the user may need an extra minute or two to finish the immediate task at hand (and, for example, won't just stop in the middle of writing an email). Likewise, if the user leaves the computer during a break and the session finishes, the clock won't automatically start a work session.

You can use this app when you study. Firstly determine session time, then break time. When you are ready, click the circle and the time will start counting down. I used my HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Progressbar.js, and Jquery skills in this application.
